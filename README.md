## Responsive Design Compatibility
This website is designed to work across different devices:

### ✅ Works On:
- **Mobile devices** (screens from 425px and up):
  - The website adapts with a clean layout and properly scaled elements.
  - Uses flexbox and CSS media queries for an optimized mobile experience.
  
- **Tablets (425px - 768px)**:
  - Elements are adjusted for tablet viewing with appropriate font sizes and layout scaling.
  - The UI remains user-friendly with easy navigation.

### ❌ Issues on Large Screens (1024px and above):
- A message **"Oops! Sorry"** appears, indicating that the website is not optimized for large screens.
- The media queries in the CSS hide the main content and only display the error message.

## Deployment
